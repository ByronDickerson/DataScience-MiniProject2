# DataScience-MiniProject2

**Task:** create a twitter scraper, create a JSON parser, and do some rudimentary data visualization
on a bunch of recent tweets

For this project you will create a python program that will do the following things:

**1.)** Pull tweets from Twitter for the following hashtags and store the resulting JSON data:
```
 #csforall
 #equality
 #stem
 #yolo 
```

Do this only for the two-day window from 2/27-2/28. Get as many tweets as you can. Keep in
mind that the standard API will only let you look 7 days back, so make sure you do this data
collection near the window! It is fine to store this data as a plain text file. Multiple plain text files
are fine. 

**2.)** Determine and print out for each hashtag: 
```
 Most frequent user
 User with most followers
 Tweet with most retweets
 Tweet with most favorites  
```

**3.)** Create a bar chart for each hashtag with time along the x axis and frequency along the y axis.
Use the data pulled in #1, and collect the frequency in 6 hour chunks. For instance, for the first
element in your #yolo chart, you will figure out the frequency of #yolo tweets from 00:00 eastern
to 05:59 eastern on 2/27. Draw the scatter plots to compare each frequency with each other
frequency across all of the other hashtags. For instance, you will need to draw the scatter plots for
yolo 0-5:59 on 2/27 with the 0-5:59 on 2/27 for csforall, equality, and stem. You donâ€™t need to
compare them across the other time brackets. There will be a lot of scatter plots. Are there any
that are correlated? Put your answer in the comments of your python source. 

**4.)** Submit your sufficiently commented source file and data file(s) via Blackboard by 11:59pm
on 3/4. This project will be worked on in teams of two or three. Teams will be assigned in class
on February 19th.

**Potential deductions:**

-100 Does not interpret/crashes

-25 Missing data for one or more hashtags

-10 Missing barchart (each)

-5 Missing barchart element (each)

-5 Missing scatterplot (each)

-10 Missing correlation comment

-25 Lack of comments
